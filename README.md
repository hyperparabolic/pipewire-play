# pipewire-play

This doesn't do a whole lot. I'm building up toward a larger audio project, and this is just a scratch space for learning things.

These demo projects use the rust bindings to libpipewire to inspect and interact with system audio.

## Contents

`flake.nix` - rust environment setup with support for LSP and debugging.
`demo1` - sub-project. enumerates all pipewire objects. functionally `pw-cli ls` with bad formatting.
